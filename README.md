# JavaScript Quiz
I made this quiz for the University of Windesheim as an assignment (homework).
I finished the project in less than 8 hours. It was pretty fun to do. This quiz is made on pure vanilla JavaScript, no libraries or frameworks used. This quiz is also fully responsive and coded dynamically. The buttons and answers of this quiz have been written in Dutch. The code itself has been fully written in English.
